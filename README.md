# High-Performance-8-Bit-Comparator-Using-Pipeline-And-Clock-Gating-Technique.
This repository documents the design and physical implementation of an 8-bit synchronous magnitude comparator optimized for high-speed operation and low power consumption. The design leverages pipelining to achieve a high operating frequency and clock gating to significantly reduce dynamic power consumption.
